# x64 Architecture Simulator

## Overview

This C++ project is a comprehensive x64 architecture simulator designed to facilitate learning, experimentation, and development in the realm of x86-64 assembly language and system programming.

## Key Features

- **Simulation of x64 Instructions:** The simulator emulates a wide range of x64 instructions, allowing users to execute and debug x86-64 assembly code within a controlled environment.

- **Memory Management:** Explore the intricacies of memory addressing and management in x64 systems. Simulate the behavior of the stack, heap, and data segments.

- **Register State Visualization:** Gain insights into the CPU's register state during program execution, aiding in understanding the effects of instructions on the processor state.

- **Interactive Shell:** Provide an interactive shell or command-line interface where users can input x86-64 assembly code, execute it, and view the results in real-time.

## Getting Started
